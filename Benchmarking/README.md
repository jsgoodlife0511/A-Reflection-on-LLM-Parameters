## Challenges in Evaluating LLMs  
There is no definitive or universally accepted method for evaluating LLMs. While various academic benchmarks such as **MMLU, BBH, and HumanEval** provide useful quantitative evaluation sets,  
these have limitations—especially when it comes to evaluating results from **domain-specific fine-tuning.**  
  
Quantitative evaluations alone are often insufficient. In most real-world applications, a hybrid approach combining **both quantitative and qualitative evaluation** methods is needed.  
This is particularly true when fine-tuning a model for **a specific use case or domain relevant to your organization.** Assessing how well the model performs in those scenarios remains an open question.  

## Evaluation Method 1: Golden Dataset & Checkpoint Tracking  
During instruction fine-tuning, one effective approach is to prepare **a golden dataset** of question–ideal answer pairs and observe how the model's responses **evolve across training checkpoints.**

This may seem simple, but it can be a surprisingly powerful way to qualitatively assess model performance. By focusing on a small set of critical or representative questions and tracking changes in the responses at each checkpoint, you can get a tangible sense of how fine-tuning is shaping the model's behavior.  

## Evaluation Method 2: LLM as a Judge  
Another method is to use a stronger or more reliable LLM as an evaluator. This requires careful prompt engineering, and it works best when clear evaluation criteria are provided.  
For example, in fact-based Q&A scenarios, you can include the relevant factual context within the prompt.  

Example prompt to the evaluator LLM:  

"The following are responses from three different LLMs to the same set of XX questions.  
Based on these answers, analyze the characteristics of each model. For each question, identify which response you prefer and explain why.  
Your evaluation should be based on (1) factual accuracy, (2) clarity/conciseness, and (3) natural language fluency."

This approach introduces a layer of structured qualitative assessment from another language model, which can be especially helpful when human evaluation is too costly or slow.  

## Evaluation Method 3: Domain-Specific Benchmarks
If you're working within a specific domain, it's beneficial to prepare a domain-specific benchmark dataset composed of objective, clearly answerable questions—preferably multiple-choice or short-answer format.  
This allows for a clear distinction between correct and incorrect responses.
  
The reliability of this evaluation heavily depends on:  
1) The quality and relevance of the questions  
2) And, ideally, expert human review of the responses
  
Using expert-reviewed datasets ensures that the evaluation reflects not only correctness but also alignment with real-world professional expectations.
