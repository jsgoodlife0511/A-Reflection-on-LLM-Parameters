# Challenges in Evaluating LLMs  
There is no definitive or universally accepted method for evaluating LLMs. While various academic benchmarks such as MMLU, BBH, and HumanEval provide useful quantitative evaluation sets,  
these have limitationsâ€”especially when it comes to evaluating results from domain-specific fine-tuning.  
  
Quantitative evaluations alone are often insufficient. In most real-world applications, a hybrid approach combining both quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods is needed.  
This is particularly true when fine-tuning a model for a specific use case or domain relevant to your organization. Assessing how well the model performs in those scenarios remains an open question.
